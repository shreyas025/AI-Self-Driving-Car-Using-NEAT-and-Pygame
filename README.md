# Self-Driving Car AI using NEAT

This project demonstrates a self-driving car simulation that uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to evolve neural networks for controlling the car. The car navigates a track while avoiding collisions, optimized through evolutionary algorithms.

## Features

- **Real-time Simulation:** Visualize car navigation and track interaction using Pygame.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with track boundaries and obstacles.
- **NEAT Integration:** Evolves neural networks to control the car's driving behavior.
- **Radar Sensors:** Five radar sensors measure distances to nearby obstacles.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Displays car movements, radar data, and collision points.
